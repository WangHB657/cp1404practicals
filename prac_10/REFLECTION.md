# Reflections on CP1404/CP5632 Practical Tasks

## Estimates and Accuracy

Throughout the course, estimating the time and effort required for practical tasks was initially challenging. My initial estimates often fell short, either underestimating the complexity of a task or overestimating my proficiency with certain concepts. However, as the course progressed, I noticed a gradual improvement in my estimation skills.

Key factors in this improvement were:

- Gaining a better understanding of the tasks through repeated practice.
- Learning to account for potential challenges and debugging time.

This skill development was evident in later practicals, where my estimates aligned more closely with the actual time taken.

## Learning from Code Reviews

Participating in code reviews was highly educational, both in reviewing others' code and receiving feedback on my own. Some key takeaways include:

- I learned the importance of writing clear, maintainable code. Reviewers often pointed out where my code could be more efficient or easier to understand, which helped me refine my coding style.

- Reviewing others' code taught me different approaches to solving problems and reinforced best practices. It also helped in consolidating my understanding of the subject matter.

The process of articulating feedback constructively was a valuable skill in itself.

## If I Were In Charge

If I were in charge of the subject, I would consider the following changes:

- Encourage pair programming or group projects for some practicals. This approach can foster collaborative skills and expose students to different coding styles and problem-solving methods.

- Introduce a wider variety of problems, including real-world scenarios, to enhance the applicability of the skills learned.
